# Advanced Shopify Theme Development: Examples
This repository contains the code for the demo store used in my free Skillshare
course, "[Advanced Shopify Theme Development]". All of the changes I make to the
demo store during the course screencasts are available here in chronological
order, so that you can step through, review, and understand each change.

When you're done working your way through the course, don't forget to try your
hand at the [class project], which will test the skills taught in this course in
a real-world scenario.


## How to use this repository
If you're not super familiar with git or GitHub (both worthwhile to learn - I'd
recommend it!), I'll give you the whirlwind tour. By reading the
[commit history] of this repository, you can see a chronology of the changes
made to the demo theme during the course.

If you'd like to walk through and implement the changes as you work through the
course, you can [download the initial theme] as a ZIP file, then upload it to
a development Shopify store. Alternatively, you can clone this repository to
your local machine, revert to the initial commit, and work from there.


## Relevant lessons
The four lessons from the Skillshare course relevant to this repository are:

1. [Product customisations]
2. [Filtering, sorting and viewing collections]
3. [Building Ajax-powered carts]
4. [Setting up advanced deployment]

You can download a zipped version of the theme at any point in time from the
[releases] page.
